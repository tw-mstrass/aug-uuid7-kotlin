# aug-uuid7-kotlin

Kotlin implementation of UUID v7 created using augmented coding

Augmented coding is [defined by Kent Beck](https://substack.com/@kentbeck/p-166781850):

> In augmented coding you care about the code, its complexity, the tests, & their coverage. The value system in
> augmented coding is similar to hand coding--tidy code that works.
